# EasyList API

The EasyList API works with [EasyList](https://www.easylist.link) and designed around the [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) architectural style. It, however, is not intended for public use but the endpoints and usage can be viewed in the code for educational purposes.

***TODO:*** Update API documentation with endpoints and examples.
