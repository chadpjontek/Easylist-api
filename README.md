# node-user-authentication-boilerplate

### _A boilerplate for creating a node API server with user authentication. Includes email verification and json web tokens to authenticate protected routes._

The purpose of this boilerplate is for myself and others to quickly get started with a node API server with user authentication and other commonly used tools.


---

***Features:***
* Includes the all the benefits of [**node-api-sever-boilerplate**](https://github.com/chadpjontek/node-api-server-boilerplate)
* Common user authentication routes, controllers, and validation schemas are already setup and can be changed to your needs.
* User **email verification** and **password recovery** email functions are ready to be personalized.
* **Json Web Tokens** are used for authentication. Expiration times can be changed to your needs. Just add your own routes and protect them with the `tokenAuth` middleware

---

***How to use:***
* To get started quickly, create a `.env` file in the root directory that contains the `PORT` environment variable you want to develop on (e.g. `PORT=3000`).
* Then create a folder called `config` and inside it create a file called `index.js`. Use this to keep all your configuration files and other files you want hidden.
```
module.exports = {
  JWT_SECRET: 'your super secret jwt secret',
  SMTP_HOST: 'smtp.gmail.com',
  SMTP_PORT: 465,
  SMTP_AUTH_USER: 'youremail@gmail.com',
  SMTP_AUTH_PASS: 'superdupersecretemailpassword',
  MAIL_FROM: '"My Email Server âœ…" <myemailserver@gmail.com>',
  DB_URI: 'mongodb+srv://mongoDBusernameandpasswordstuffhere',
  DOMAIN: 'localhost',
  PROTOCOL: 'http'
};
```
* You can choose another method to do this but will need to change the required files as necessary.
* Create tests and put them in the `./tests` folder. Then run them with `npm test`.
* To run server in development mode, run `npm start`. Saved changes will result in webpack rebuilding the bundle and nodemon restarting the server.
* To create a production build, run `npm run build`. The output will be in the `/dist` folder.
